Certainly, let's delve deeper into why making variables public can lead to strong dependencies between classes and why this can be problematic, using an example.

Suppose you have a "Time" class with the following implementation:

java

public class Time {
    public int hour;
    public int minute;
    
    public Time(int hour, int minute) {
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
    }
}

And you have another class, "TimeClient," that uses the "Time" class:

java

public class TimeClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(9, 30);
        System.out.println("Hour: " + time.hour); // Accessing hour directly
        time.hour = 10; // Modifying hour directly
        System.out.println("Updated Hour: " + time.hour);
    }
}

In this scenario, the "hour" variable in the "Time" class is public, so it can be accessed and modified directly from the "TimeClient" class.

Now, let's say you decide to change the internal representation of time in the "Time" class to use a 24-hour format instead of 12-hour format:

java

public class Time {
    public int hour24; // Change variable name to hour24
    public int minute;
    
    public Time(int hour24, int minute) {
        this.hour24 = hour24;
        this.minute = minute;
    }
}

With the "hour" variable being public, you might think you only need to update the "Time" class itself. However, because other classes like "TimeClient" directly accessed and modified the "hour" variable, you now have a problem:

java

public class TimeClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(9, 30);
        System.out.println("Hour: " + time.hour); // This will not work anymore
        time.hour = 10; // This will result in a compilation error
    }
}

As you can see, the change in the "Time" class to use "hour24" instead of "hour" has broken the "TimeClient" class. This is because making the "hour" variable public created a strong dependency between the two classes. When you change the internal structure of the "Time" class, any other class that relies on this public variable will likely need to be updated as well. This can become a maintenance nightmare in larger software projects with many classes and dependencies.

In contrast, if you had used methods to access and modify the "hour" variable in the "Time" class, you could have hidden the internal details of how the time is stored, and changes to the internal representation would not affect other classes. This encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that promotes robust and maintainable code.
